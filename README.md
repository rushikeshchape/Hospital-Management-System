# Hospital-Management-System
### About
Welcome to my student project, a Hospital Management System implemented with Spring REST APIs. This backend-focused endeavor is designed to streamline healthcare management, catering to the needs of hospitals, physicians, and nurses. It simplifies clinical documentation and medication management, enhancing patient care and administrative efficiency. While this project currently lacks a frontend, it leverages Java 8, Spring Boot, MySQL, and modern technologies to deliver a robust healthcare solution. Join me in my journey to advance healthcare management, learn, and contribute to the world of software development.
